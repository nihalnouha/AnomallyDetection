# Real-Time Market Data Processing with Quix Streams

This project demonstrates a real-time stock market data processing pipeline using **Quix Streams**, **Streamlit**, and **ElasticSearch**. It processes high-frequency financial data to detect patterns and anomalies efficiently.

---

## Overview of the Architecture

1. **Data Sources**:
   - **Databento**: Provides raw market data from sources like:
     - NASDAQ
     

2. **Quix Streams**:
   - Acts as the central processing engine for streaming data. It enables:
     - Preprocessing of market data.
     - Advanced analytics and feature generation.
     - Integration with machine learning models for anomaly detection or other insights.

3. **Redis Integration**:
   - Represents the distributed, fault-tolerant streaming of data.

4. **Visualization and Storage**:
   - **Streamlit**: Provides an interactive, real-time dashboard for visualizing processed data.
   - **ElasticSearch**: Stores processed and aggregated data for advanced querying and monitoring.

5. **Containerization**:
   - The entire architecture is containerized using **Docker**, ensuring portability and seamless deployment.

## Features

- **High-Frequency Data Processing**:
  - Handles large volumes of real-time data from multiple financial sources.
- **Flexible Analytics**:
  - Leverages Quix Streams for scalable, low-latency streaming analytics.
- **Interactive Dashboards**:
  - Real-time insights via a Streamlit-powered UI.
- **Robust Storage**:
  - Uses ElasticSearch for querying and storing processed data.
- **Scalability**:
  - Built with a modular, Docker-based architecture for ease of scaling.

## System Components

1. **Databento Data Sources**:
   - Fetches high-frequency data from stock exchanges like NASDAQ and CME.
2. **Quix Streams**:
   - Processes incoming streams and applies advanced analytics.
   - Integrates seamlessly with machine learning models if needed.
3. **Streamlit Dashboard**:
   - Provides a live visualization of streaming data and analysis results.
4. **ElasticSearch**:
   - Stores and indexes the processed data for querying and future analysis.
5. **Docker**:
   - Simplifies deployment and ensures consistent performance across environments.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnomallyDetection/quix-streams-project
   cd quix-streams-project
   ```

2. Configure the environment:
   - Set up your Databento API credentials in the `.env` file.
   - Configure ElasticSearch and Streamlit settings.


## How It Works

1. Market data streams from **Databento** sources into **Quix Streams**.
2. **Quix Streams** processes the data in real-time, applying analytics and custom logic.
3. Results are distributed across different paths:
   - Visualized in **Streamlit**.
   - Stored in **ElasticSearch** for further analysis or long-term storage.
4. The entire pipeline runs in a Dockerized environment for scalability and reliability.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate machine learning models for predictive analytics.
- Add support for other data sources or exchanges.
- Enhance visualization capabilities in the Streamlit dashboard.
